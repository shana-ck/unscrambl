# Word Unscramble Game
This game uses the [3of6game list](http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts-readme/#3of6) as the starting point. Slurs and some swears have been removed as well as some British spellings of words. The resulting wordlist was then run through a TrieNode process to generate a fully solved wordlist to use.

For simplicity/gameplay reasons, the maximum length of word is limited to 14 letters. A starter word is valid as long as there are at least 10 words with 4 or more letters that can be made from the starter word.

This was inspired by games like Words on Stream, Scrabble, and other word puzzles.

## Gameplay
There are a number of options available to customize gameplay. The minimum word length at difficulty 3 is best kept at 4 letters since there will be occasions where there are fewer than 10 words with 5 or more letters; however, if you like a challenge, you can set the minimum word length to 5 letters.

I don't want to explain the alternate scoring method. I don't know what I was thinking.
